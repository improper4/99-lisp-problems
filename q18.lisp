;	(**) Extract a slice from a list.
;	Given two indices, I and K, the slice is the list containing the elements between the I'th and K'th element of
;	the original list (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 1.
;	
;	Example:
;	* (slice '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3 7)
;	(C D E F G)

(defun slice (lst start end)
	(subseq lst (- start 1) end))
